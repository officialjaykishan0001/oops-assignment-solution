Question : what are the benifit of using setter and getter methods to access the by 
private instance variebles ?

Answer : 
        setter and getter are the functions of the class . that are used to assign and 
        print the values of the variebles which are private in class . setter assigns the 
        value to the varielbles and getter prints the value of the variebles on the screen .

        below , the example of these two user defined function inside the class.

    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;

    class rectangle{
        int l ;
        int b;

        public : 
        void setter(int x,int y)//this is the setter function
        {
            l = x;
            b = y ;

        }

        void getter() //this is the getter function
        {
          cout<<"l is : "<<l<<"\nb is : "<<(b)<<endl;
        }
    };
    int main()
    {
        rectangle s;
        s.setter(3,4) ; //calling the setter class function
        s.getter();//calling the getter class function 

        return 0;
    }
