Question : why we need constructor explain it and give an example ?

Answer : 
        we need constructor to assign some value to the variebles of the class.let we have 
        a class and the variebles of this class are private then we are not able to assign 
        some value to  the varieble from the main function in this condition the we use of 
        constructor came out more importantly. constructor are defined inside the class 
        but constructors are able to assign the value to the varieble which are private .
        basicaly , constructor are the three types 
        1.default constructor
        2.parameterised constructor
        3.copy constructor 
now, lets see the costructor in the form of source code ,

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class area{
    int l;
    int b;

  publice :

  area()//this is the default constructor
  {
    int l = 0;
    int b = 0;
  }  

  area(int x,int x)//this the parameterised constructor
  {
    l = x;
    b = y;
  }
/*
  area(area &copy_object_name)//this is the copy constructor .
  {
    l = object_name.l;
    b = object_name.b;
  }*/
};
int main()
{
 
 return 0;
}
