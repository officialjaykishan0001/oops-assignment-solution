Question : How does the inheritance allows you to reuse code in the program ?

Answer : 
let's understand this by an example
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class vehicle{
    string name;
    int inr ;

};

class bmw : public vehicle{
    //this inherited the class vehicle.

};

class rollsroyles : public vehicle{
    //this is also inherited the class vehicle
};

int main()
{
    return 0;
}

As you see in the program class vehicle is the parent class of other classes 
becouse all the other class are child or sub-class . in program we only defined vehicle
class and the property of the vehicle class is accessible by the other classes. this way
the inheritance make reusalabilty of the code.
